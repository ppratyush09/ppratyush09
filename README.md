# 👋 Greetings, fellow wanderers of the digital realm! Welcome to my GitHub fortress!  

I’m **Pratyush Pritimay**, a passionate cybersecurity sentinel with over three years of experience safeguarding the cyber frontier. My journey began as an eager **Intern**, delving into the depths of **SOC operations**. Since then, I've leveled up to become a **Threat Analyst**, wielding expertise in:  
- 🛡️ **Digital Forensics** - Analyzing digital crime scenes through meticulous artifact analysis. From registry hives and shadow copies to memory dumps and volatile footprints, I unravel timelines, trace adversary actions, and reveal the hidden narrative that every byte conceals.
  
- 🔍 **Incident Response** - Turning disruption into order with precision and speed. From containment and eradication to recovery and resilience-building, I thrive in the heat of intrusions—coordinating investigations, neutralizing live threats, and restoring stability without missing a step.

- 🎯 **Threat Hunting** - From Hypothesis-driven hunts that test theories of adversary behavior to Data-driven explorations that surface hidden anomalies, my craft spans every angle of proactive defense. I leverage Intelligence-guided hunts to pursue emerging campaigns, IOC-based sweeps to uncover known traces, and TTP-focused investigations mapped to MITRE ATT&CK. Alongside these, I execute Guided hunts powered by vendor playbooks and threat intel packages—balancing intuition, analytics, and structure to outpace even the most adaptive attackers. 

Whether it’s decrypting mysteries, neutralizing threats, or fortifying digital strongholds, I thrive on turning chaos into order.
